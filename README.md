## Coin-Collection-Game

## Introduction

This is a simple two-player coin game where players take turns selecting coins from either end of a list of 12 coins. The game continues until there are no more coins left. The player with the maximum number of coins at the end wins.

## How to Play

1. Start the game with a list of 12 coins, numbered from 1 to 12.

2. Players take turns to make a move:
   - Player 1 selects a coin from either the first or last position in the list. The selected coin is added to their credit, and the coin is removed from the list.
   - Player 2 follows the same rules and makes their selection.

3. The game continues until there are no more coins left in the list.

4. After the last coin has been picked, the player with the highest credit wins the game.

## Rules

- Players can only choose coins from the first or last position of the list.
- The selected coin is added to the player's credit.
- The first and last coins are removed from the list after each selection.
- The game continues until all 12 coins have been chosen.
- The player with the most coins in their credit at the end is the winner.

## Example

Here's an example of how the game might progress:

- Initial List: [15, 12, 43, 84, 55, 36, 67, 98, 19, 20, 51, 72]

  - Player 1 chooses the coin at the last position 12 with maximum value (72).
  - List after Player 1's move: [ 12, 43, 84, 55, 36, 67, 98, 19, 20, 51]
  - Player 2 chooses the coin at the first position (2).
  - List after Player 2's move: [ 43, 84, 55, 36, 67, 98, 19, 20]
